# Application Designer 
Application Designer is a Maximo configuration tool used to customize the user interface (UI) of applications — without writing Java code.
It allows you to:
* Modify or create application layouts (like Work Order Tracking, Asset, Location, etc.)
* Add or remove fields, tabs, tables, buttons
* Control visibility and access
* Add custom dialogs or launch points for automation scripts
* All this can be done visually through the Maximo UI.
In Maximo, we can create three types of applications using Application Designer:
1️⃣ Power Applications – Full-featured apps for advanced users (e.g., Work Order Tracking).
2️⃣ Self-Service Applications – Simplified apps for end users (e.g., Service Request).
3️⃣ Single Page Applications – Modern, fast apps used in Work Centers or mobile environments.
